<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A mince pie is a traditional British pastry enjoyed especially during the Christmas season. 
Despite its name, it does not typically contain meat in modern recipes. 
Instead, it is filled with mincemeat, a sweet mixture of dried fruits, spices, and
 sometimes nuts, combined with suet or a vegetarian fat. The filling is often flavored with 
 festive spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, and sometimes a splash of brandy or citrus 
 zest is added for extra richness.</p>
<p>The pie is made using a shortcrust pastry, which is buttery, crumbly, and golden brown after 
baking. Mince pies are typically small, individual-sized treats, perfect for snacking or serving 
with a cup of tea or mulled wine. They are often dusted with powdered sugar for a snowy, festive appearance.</p>
<p>Historically, mince pies had a savory origin, containing minced meat, spices, and fruit, a 
practice dating back to the medieval period. Over time, the recipe evolved into the sweet treat 
we know today, retaining its name as a nod to its origins.</p>
