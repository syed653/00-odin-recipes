<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A pizza is a popular dish originating from Italy, now beloved worldwide. 
    It consists of a flat, round base made from yeast-leavened dough, typically topped 
    with tomato sauce, cheese, and various ingredients, then baked in an oven. 
    Pizzas can range from simple classics like Margherita, which features fresh basil, 
    mozzarella, and tomatoes, to more elaborate variations with a variety of meats, 
    vegetables, and gourmet toppings.
</p>
<p> The crust can vary in style, from thin and crispy to thick and fluffy, like the 
    deep-dish pizzas of Chicago. The sauce is usually a savory tomato-based mixture, sometimes 
    replaced with alternatives like pesto or white garlic sauce. Cheese, especially mozzarella, 
    is a key component, providing a gooey and satisfying texture.</p>
