<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a beloved Italian dish consisting of multiple layers of wide pasta sheets, 
    savory fillings, and rich sauces. Traditionally, it features layers of meat sauce 
    (like Bolognese), béchamel (a creamy white sauce), and cheese (often mozzarella and Parmesan). 
    </p> <p>The dish is then baked until golden and bubbly, creating a deliciously comforting 
    and hearty meal. Variations include vegetarian versions with spinach, mushrooms, or 
    other vegetables. The combination of textures and flavors makes lasagna a satisfying 
    and iconic comfort food.</p>
